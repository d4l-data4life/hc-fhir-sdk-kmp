/**
 * FhirMedicationStatement
 *
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A MedicationStatement may indicate
 * that the patient may be taking the medication now, or has taken the medication in the past or will
 * be taking the medication in the future. The source of this information can be the patient,
 * significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A common scenario where this
 * information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay. The
 * medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription
 * bottle, or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains
 *
 * The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the
 * medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual
 * administration information from the person who administered the medication. A medication statement
 * is often, if not always, less specific. There is no required date/time when the medication was
 * administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication,
 * where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or
 * missing or less precise. As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the
 * patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or
 * other party maintains. Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed
 * information.
