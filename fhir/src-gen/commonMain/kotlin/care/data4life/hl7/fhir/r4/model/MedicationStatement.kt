/**
 * FhirMedicationStatement
 *
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A MedicationStatement may indicate
 * that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be
 * taking the medication in the future. The source of this information can be the patient, significant
 * other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A common scenario where this information
 * is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay. The medication
 * information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle, or from
 * a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.   The primary difference
 * between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration
 * has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the
 * person who administered the medication. A medication statement is often, if not always, less
 * specific. There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know
 * that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time,
 * quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise. As stated
 * earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a
 * prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
 * Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
